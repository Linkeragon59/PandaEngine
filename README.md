# Panda Engine

Mini game engine I wrote for fun and to give me a base to code other small projects on top of it. I'm adding features whenever required by the projects I base on it.
It's capable of rendering 2D (with ImGui) and 3D using the Vulkan API.

Current projects built on top of Panda Engine:
- Playing with NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). Implemented NEAT in a separate static lib that I can use from the Panda Engine projects. Implemented a training of the CartPole and Acrobot problems
